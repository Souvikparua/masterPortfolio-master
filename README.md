Introduction
This documentation provides a guide for building a portfolio website using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A portfolio website serves as a showcase of your work, skills, and accomplishments, making it an essential tool for professionals in various fields such as web development, design, photography, and writing.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - To install Node.js, visit nodejs.org and follow the instructions for your operating system.
Setup
Follow these steps to set up your React portfolio website:

Create a new React application: Use the Create React App tool to quickly set up a new React project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app portfolio-website
Replace portfolio-website with your desired project name.

Navigate to the project directory: Move into the newly created project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd portfolio-website
Start the development server: Start the development server to see your React application in action:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start a development server and open your default web browser to view the application.

Clean up the default files: Remove the unnecessary files generated by Create React App, such as the default logo, styles, and boilerplate code.
